# Alternative-route-to-curbing-Opioid-crisis
Opioid epidemic is a matter of concern in the United States since 2008. Opioids obtained from illegal sources and legal sources contribute to the crisis. However, opioids obtained through prescription drugs account for nearly 40% deaths due to opioid overdose in US. Government either provide addiction treatment or intervene in the over consumption of the prescribed opioid drugs. Therefore this project takes an unconventional approach to curb opioid crisis by identifying over prescribers for a specialty and in a state using socio-economic indicators and states polies for schedule II drugs usage.
