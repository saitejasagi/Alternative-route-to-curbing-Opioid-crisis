**Objective**

Opioid epidemic is a matter of concern in the United States since 2008. Opioids obtained from illegal sources and legal sources contribute to the crisis. However, opioids obtained through prescription drugs account for nearly 40% deaths due to opioid overdose in US. Government either provide addiction treatment or intervene in the over consumption of the prescribed opioid drugs. Therefore this project takes an unconventional approach to curb opioid crisis by identifying over prescribers for a specialty and in a state using socio-economic indicators and states polies for schedule II drugs usage.


**Synopsis**

The dataset provides information on prescription drugs prescribed by individual physicians and other health care providers and paid for under the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program for the calendar year 2017. The data set identifies providers by their National Provider Identifier (NPI) and summarizes for each prescriber the total number of prescriptions that were dispensed, which include original prescriptions and any refills, and the total drug cost. The total drug cost includes the ingredient cost of the medication, dispensing fees, sales tax, and any applicable administration fees and is based on the amount paid by the Part D plan, Medicare beneficiary, government subsidies, and any other third-party payers.
